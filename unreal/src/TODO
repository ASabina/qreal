General:
- New URL for our stuff. Something like Qt's internal ":/dir/file" scheme.
  My proposal is: "%/repo/diagram/element" or something like that.

EditorView && UML:: namespace stuff 
- Adjust link ends when creating elements is finished
  (so that link can refer to element that is added later)
