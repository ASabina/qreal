General:
- New URL for our stuff. Something like Qt's internal ":/dir/file" scheme.
  My proposal is: "%/repo/diagram/element" or something like that.

EditorView && UML:: namespace stuff 
*DONE* Adjust link ends when creating elements is finished
       (so that link can refer to element that is added later)

- Implement a simple "class editor" to show masta our progress :)

That is (in this order):
    - Save & restore x & y coordinates
    - Save & restore port no. for links
    - "Glamour" classes, links, comments.
    - Save & restore misc properties (in one field, for now....)
    - Reworked interface
    - Multi-part links
