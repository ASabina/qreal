General:
- New URL for our stuff. Something like Qt's internal ":/dir/file" scheme.
  My proposal is: "%/repo/diagram/element" or something like that.

EditorView && UML:: namespace stuff 
*DONE* Adjust link ends when creating elements is finished
       (so that link can refer to element that is added later)

- Implement a simple "class editor" to show masta our progress :)
