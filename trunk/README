Right now we add everything buildable to the main qmake file, like in the
K+M-REAL. I am too lazy to split up these files, but sometime in future we
should move to one-makefile-per-dir structure.

Right now we have:

 src/
    build/	- buildsystem, all files right now are built there
    editors/	- editor-building tools & generated sources
    images/     - images
    main/	- main file
    mainwindow/ - some GUI stuff 
    misc/	- global includes
    repo/	- repository
    shapes/     - SVG shapes
    umllib/	- elements to be placed on diagrams
    view/	- view module



To build this project:
    $ cd src/build
    $ qmake && make
    $ ./real
